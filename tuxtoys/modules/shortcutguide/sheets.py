"""What Shortcut Guide lists, as data: sheets (a tab each in the window), their groups, and
in each group the shortcuts, each with its label and either its keys or the setting that
holds them.

A label is a message in some gettext domain: TuxToys' own, or the program's whose shortcut
it is (Cinnamon's, Nemo's), so that it reads as that program's own menus and settings do in
the user's language. Free of GTK, so it tests anywhere.
